# Random Software Principles Aggregator

A C# application that scrapes technical articles from various programming and development websites to collect interesting facts and articles. This project is meant for the Stage Three Tax in Telex integration, hosted on Render using Docker.

### Telex Integration

The scraper is designed to work as a Telex integration. When integrated with Telex:

1. The scraper automatically sends articles to your Telex channels
2. No manual API calls needed - Telex handles the webhook communication
3. Articles are posted at configured intervals

## Features

- Scrapes articles from multiple sources:
    - GeeksForGeeks (popular and recent articles)
    - MDN Web Docs (featured articles)
- Randomly selects articles from each source
- Extracts article titles, content, and URLs
- Error handling and logging for failed scraping attempts
- Summarizes articles with Groq and sends them to a Telex channel
